# How to contribute

Pull requests are great! Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Make your changes inside a topic branch `git checkout -b my_descriptive_change`

3. Add a test for your change.

4. Make sure the tests pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

# What we need

Currently the test coverage is lacking at best, so also feel free to add appropriate tests to verify existing functionality.

The documentation is also entirely missing, so feel free to write some documentation and submit it via pull request.
